      <h5>I'm attending a 3-day conference at the Javits Center in Manhattan and need a hotel within a 10-minute walk since I'll be going back and forth multiple times daily. I have severe dust allergies so I need a hotel with HEPA air filters or hypoallergenic rooms. I'll be working late, so I need 24-hour room service and a desk with an ergonomic chair. I'd prefer a hotel with a good gym that opens by 5am since I work out before meetings. My company will reimburse up to 275 dollars per night, but I'd like to keep it under 250 dollars if possible. I need strong, reliable Wi-Fi that can handle video calls. I'd like a higher floor room away from the elevator for noise reasons. I'll arrive Wednesday afternoon and leave Saturday morning.</h5>
