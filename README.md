Business Traveler with Specific Needs

"I'm attending a 3-day conference at the Javits Center in Manhattan and need a hotel within a 10-minute walk since I'll be going back and forth multiple times daily. I have severe dust allergies so I need a hotel with HEPA air filters or hypoallergenic rooms. I'll be working late, so I need 24-hour room service and a desk with an ergonomic chair. I'd prefer a hotel with a good gym that opens by 5am since I work out before meetings. My company will reimburse up to 275 dollars per night, but I'd like to keep it under 250 dollars if possible. I need strong, reliable Wi-Fi that can handle video calls. I'd like a higher floor room away from the elevator for noise reasons. I'll arrive Wednesday afternoon and leave Saturday morning."
Family with Multiple Constraints

Family with Multiple Constraints

"We're a family of 6 (2 adults, 4 kids ages 3, 7, 10, and 14) looking for a beach vacation in Southern California during spring break (April 3-10). We need a hotel or resort that has both a kids' club for the younger ones and teen activities for our oldest. We require connecting rooms or a suite with at least 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. Our 3-year-old has food allergies (nuts, dairy) so we need a hotel with allergen-friendly dining options or a kitchen where we can prepare meals. We want to be within walking distance to the beach (preferably less than 5 minutes with small children). Budget is $400/night maximum. We don't drive so we need to be near public transportation or within walking distance to restaurants and attractions. The hotel needs to have a heated pool since the ocean might be too cold. Our 10-year-old uses a wheelchair occasionally, so accessibility is important."

Specialized Travel Group

"I'm organizing a retreat for 15 senior citizens who are amateur painters. We need a quiet countryside hotel within 2 hours of Philadelphia with mountain or lake views that would be good to paint. We'll need a large meeting room with natural light for our daily 3-hour painting sessions. Half of our group has mobility issues, so no stairs and we need elevator access to all areas. We want farm-to-table dining options with accommodations for low-sodium diets (7 people), gluten-free (3 people), and vegetarian (2 people). The hotel should have gardens for inspiration and covered outdoor seating in case of light rain. We're looking to stay for 5 nights in mid-June (15-20) and need single occupancy rooms under $150/night including breakfast. We'd prefer a place without lots of young children or corporate events happening at the same time. We'll have our own transportation but want to be within 30 minutes of a hospital just in case." 

Unique Experience Seeker

"I'm celebrating my 40th birthday and want something truly unique. I'm looking for a hotel that's either in a converted historical building (like an old castle, lighthouse, or monastery) or has themed rooms. I don't want a chain hotel. I'd prefer something with fewer than 30 rooms for a more intimate feel. I'm specifically looking in the Pacific Northwest (Oregon or Washington) for a 4-night stay in August (12-16). I'll be with my partner and we're both vegan, so we need at least some plant-based options on-site or within walking distance. We don't drive, so it needs to be accessible by train or bus from Seattle. We enjoy stargazing, so minimal light pollution would be a bonus. Our budget is up to $300/night. We're both light sleepers, so we need a quiet room away from common areas. We also both have chemical sensitivities, so a hotel that uses natural cleaning products would be ideal. We'd like to bring our small dog (15 lbs) if possible." 

Long-term Business Traveler

"I need a hotel in downtown Chicago for a 6-week consulting project starting September 8th. I'll need to check out on October 20th. I need weekly housekeeping, on-site laundry facilities or service, and a kitchenette at minimum. I'll need a decent workspace in the room with a comfortable chair since I'll be working remotely most evenings. I'm a Marriott Platinum member, so I'd prefer a Marriott property to earn points, but I'm open to extended stay hotels with better amenities. I need to be within 3 blocks of the Blue Line for easy access to O'Hare, as I'll fly home most weekends (Friday evening to Sunday night). I'd like a fitness center or complimentary access to a nearby gym. I have a severe shellfish allergy, so I need to be able to communicate easily with restaurant staff. My company caps reimbursement at $220/night including taxes, so I need to stay under that. I'd prefer a king bed, rainfall shower, and a room with a view if possible. I'm also a very light sleeper, so soundproofing or a quiet location is essential."
